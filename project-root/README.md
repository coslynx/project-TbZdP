# Project Overview

Develop a small blog site using PHP on a shared server with fast fulltext search capability. Support searching through up to 500 articles, each around 2000 words, totaling 5-10 MB of text data. Precompute indices for fast search and utilize in-memory cache like apc_store. Avoid third-party services for self-contained search functionality. Implement search that triggers after three characters are typed and returns a maximum of ten results.

## Features

- Implement fast fulltext search functionality in PHP for articles on the blog site.
- Precompute and store indices on disk for quick access.
- Utilize in-memory cache like apc_store for faster retrieval.
- Develop search functionality that activates after three characters are typed.
- Limit search results to a maximum of ten for efficiency.
- Create a trie or direct lookup for prefixes of length 3-4 to speed up searches.
- Ensure the search is self-contained and does not rely on external services.
- Optimize search performance for the small data volume of the blog site.
- Include error handling for search queries to provide a seamless user experience.

## Enhancements

- Implement autocomplete suggestions based on user input for quicker search.
- Incorporate fuzzy search capability to account for typos or variations in search terms.
- Integrate a ranking system to display search results based on relevance.
- Include a search history feature for users to easily access past searches.
- Optimize search algorithms periodically to maintain efficiency as the blog site grows.
- Enhance the user interface for a more intuitive search experience.

## Programming Languages

PHP will be used for backend development to implement the search functionality efficiently.

## APIs

No external APIs will be integrated as the search functionality will be self-contained.

## Packages and Libraries

APCu package (latest version) will be utilized for in-memory caching with apc_store to improve search performance. No additional packages or libraries are required as the project aims for simplicity and minimal dependencies.

## Rationale

PHP is chosen for its ease of use and compatibility with shared servers, making it suitable for a small blog site. APCu is selected for in-memory caching as it offers a simple and effective solution for storing precomputed indices. Avoiding external APIs reduces dependencies and potential points of failure, ensuring a self-contained search functionality.

## Project Implementation

Develop PHP scripts to precompute and store indices on disk for quick access during searches. Integrate apc_store to utilize in-memory caching for faster retrieval of search results. Implement search functionality that triggers after three characters are typed to enhance user experience. Limit search results to a maximum of ten to maintain efficiency and provide relevant information. Create a trie data structure or direct lookup for prefixes of length 3-4 to speed up search queries.

## Future Enhancements

- Add autocomplete suggestions based on user input to improve search efficiency.
- Incorporate fuzzy search capability to handle typos and variations in search terms for better user experience.
- Integrate a ranking system to display search results based on relevance to enhance search accuracy.
- Include a search history feature for users to easily access and revisit past searches for convenience.
- Optimize search algorithms periodically to ensure efficient performance as the blog site data volume grows.
- Enhance the user interface to provide a more intuitive and user-friendly search experience for visitors.
